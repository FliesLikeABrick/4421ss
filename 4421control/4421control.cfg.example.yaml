scripts:
    # location of action, status, etc scripts; with trailing /
    directory: "bin/"

    # glob to use for identifying potential scripts in the configured directory
    # Useful for if the scripts directory contains files that 4421control should not even consider
    # e.g. for script files with extensions only: *-*.*
    # for only python files: *-*.py
    # for any files: *
    glob: "*-*.*"

    # pattern to derive target names and states from file names
    # Uses python regex named groups "target" and "state", and optional "type" (not currently used)
    pattern: "(?P<target>[a-zA-Z0-9]+)-(?P<state>[a-zA-Z0-9]+).?(?P<type>[a-zA-Z0-9]*)"

    # Optional explicit configuration file for adding script names or descriptions
    # Keys available per script:
    #    name: short/formatted name
    #    description: long description of the script
    # Default: no description text
    # Note: All scripts matchin the glob and pattern above will be loaded,
    #   regardless of whether they have additional information listed here
    # NOTE: This configuration layout may change or be removed in future versions
    #   if better means of loading script information is found (such as target-info.yaml files in the scripts directory)
