scripts:
    # location of action, status, etc scripts; with trailing /
    directory: "bin/"
    # glob to use for identifying potential scripts in the configured directory
    # Useful for if the scripts directory contains files that 4421control should not even consider
    # e.g. for script files with extensions only: *-*.*
    # for only python files: *-*.py
    # for any files: *
    glob: "*-*.*"
    # pattern to derive target names and states from file names
    # Uses named groups "target" and "state", and optional "type" (not currently used)
    pattern: "(?P<target>[a-zA-Z0-9]+)-(?P<state>[a-zA-Z0-9]+).?(?P<type>[a-zA-Z0-9]*)"
    # optional explicit configuration file for adding script names or descriptions
    # Default: no description text
